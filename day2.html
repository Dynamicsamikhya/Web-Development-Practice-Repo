HTML consists of various elements, that are responsible for telling search engines how to display page content. For example, headings, lists, images, links, and more.</p>
<h1>HTML Elements and Tags</h1>
<p>HTML uses predefined tags and elements that instruct the browser on how to display the content. HTML elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag. Itâ€™s important to remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.
