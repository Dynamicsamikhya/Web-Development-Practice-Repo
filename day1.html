	<h1>Founding</h1>
<p>The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release. Its name was chosen as a compound of Git and hub.

    <h1>Structure of the organization</h1>
<p>GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management.Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries.
In 2014, the company added a layer of middle management in response to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership. As a result of the scandal, Tom Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.
</p>
	<h1>Finance</h1>
<p>In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds. The round valued the company at approximately $15 billion.[24]
